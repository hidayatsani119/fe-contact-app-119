## 🤝 API Integration

The app is designed to consume a RESTful API with the following endpoints (inferred from usage):

  - **Users**: `/users/login`, `/users`, `/users/current`, `/users/logout`
  - **Contacts**: `/contacts`, `/contacts/:id`
  - **Addresses**: `/contacts/:contactId/addresses`, `/contacts/:contactId/addresses/:addressId`

All authenticated requests must include the Authorization header with the user's token.
